<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I became interested in coding when my mom showed me a video of a programmer making tic tac toe in python. 
  From 2015 (high-school) to now, I learned so much about computer science. 
  I learned how to make games, build websites, make a calculator, and a vending machine. 
  I have been exposed to different languages and technologies such as Java, C++, C#, C, Python, Git, 
  Cloud Computing (AWS), SQL, Spring MVC, Unreal, and even Unity.</p>

<p>My current goal is to become as versatile as possible. 
  One thing I learned about myself is that I get very bored doing the same thing for a certain or short period of time. 
  In this field, there's always something new to learn which will always keep it fresh for me.
  Currently my main interests are software engineering (general), web development and game development.

<p>During my free time, I love playing video games, watching anything horror-related and working out.</p>
